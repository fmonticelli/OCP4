## ETCD encryption

##### Encrypt etcd data

Modify the API server object and set the encryption field type to `aescbc`

```
oc patch apiservers.config.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  --patch '{"spec": {"encryption": {"type": "aescbc"}}}'
```

The encryption will start and it will take a while ... wait until the encryption process is completed.

##### Check the encryption status

Review the encrypted status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted.

```
oc get openshiftapiserver \
  -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
```

It's done when you get the following output:

```
EncryptionCompleted
All resources encrypted: routes.route.openshift.io, oauthaccesstokens.oauth.openshift.io, oauthauthorizetokens.oauth.openshift.io
```

Review the Encrypted status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted.

```
oc get kubeapiserver \
  -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
```

It's done when you get the following output:

```
EncryptionCompleted
All resources encrypted: secrets, configmaps
```

##### Decrypt etcd data

Modify the API server object and set the encryption field type to `identity`

```
oc patch apiservers.config.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  --patch '{"spec": {"encryption": {"type": "identity"}}}'
```

##### Check the decryptipon status

Review the Decrypted status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted

```
oc get openshiftapiserver /
  -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
```

It's done when you get the following output:

```
DecryptionCompleted
Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
```

Review the Encrypted status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted

```
oc get kubeapiserver \
  -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
```

It's done when you get the following output:

```
DecryptionCompleted
Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
```
